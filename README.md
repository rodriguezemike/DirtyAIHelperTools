# DirtyAIHelperTools

This repository contains a collection of quick, "dirty" scripts designed to leverage OpenAI's API for various development tasks. These tools were created to solve problems fast, without worrying too much about perfect code structure or aesthetics. If you need a pragmatic solution that gets the job done quickly, this is the place for you.

## What is this?
The **DirtyAIHelperTools** repository is a set of lightweight, practical scripts that utilize OpenAI’s API to assist with different development tasks. These tools were built for quick results, often in a hacky or "just-get-it-done" fashion. 

They aren't meant to be production-ready or to follow best practices—just practical, working scripts you can quickly deploy for your development needs.

## Dependencies
These scripts depend on:
- `openai`: For accessing OpenAI’s powerful models and tools.
- `dotenv`: For managing environment variables, particularly your OpenAI API key.

Make sure you have these installed before running any of the scripts.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
```text
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

4. Explore and run the various scripts based on your needs. They are designed to be simple and easy to use. For example:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
